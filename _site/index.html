            <h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>

<p>Fifth Continent are a web development agency. We help people turn their ideas into easy to use, thoughtful products, and we find the simplest way to do it. Our expertise is in the nuts and bolts, the backend processes and infrastructure that power digital products.</p>

<p>We would be good people to talk to you if you have an idea for a new platform and you’re not sure how to start getting it online. We’d also be great people to talk to if your project is getting stuck in details and you can’t find your way through to launching. We can build the whole thing from a sketch on a piece of paper to production. We’re also happy to slot into an existing team, and help out where you need it, or just help you understand what you need to change to get things done.</p>

<p>We are small, but work with some of the largest companies. We are well practised at working remotely, so we can work with you wherever you are.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-use-to-build-our-projects">What we use to build our projects</h2>

<p>We use <strong>python</strong> in pretty much all of our projects. We’re very good at python.</p>

<p>We often use a <strong>serverless</strong> approach, and use the serverless framework for infrastructure and deployment, and Terraform for other infrastructure.</p>

<p>Everything we code will have excellent test coverage, and will use continuous integration. <strong>Test driven development</strong> is our thing.</p>

<p>Deploying your project will be a breeze, git push and it’s done. On the front end we will use whatever framework is appropriate - this site uses Jekyll, which is just the ticket here, but more usually it would be react or something similar.</p>

<p>We also know a lot about the <strong>data science and data engineering</strong> tool kit, and are very experienced at building a pipeline to turn your machine learning Jupyter notebooks into something with a web UI that people can actually use.</p>

<h2 id="where-we-are">Where we are</h2>

<p>We are based on Romney Marsh, at the south eastern edge of England. It’s sometimes called the fifth continent, a name from a time when geographers divided the world into four continents. Its a a place that still feels apart from the world.</p>

<p>We are as close to Lille as we are to London and have worked on projects across Europe.</p>
