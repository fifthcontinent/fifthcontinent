## What we use to build our projects

We use **python** in pretty much all of our projects. We’re very good at python. 

We often use a **serverless** approach, and use the serverless framework for infrastructure and deployment, and Terraform for other infrastructure. 

Everything we code will have excellent test coverage, and will use continuous integration. **Test driven development** is our thing. 

Deploying your site will be a breeze, git push and it’s done. On the front end we will use whatever framework is appropriate - this site uses Jekyll, which is just the ticket here, but more usually it would be react or something similar.

We also know a lot about the **data science and data engineering** tool kit, and are very experienced at building a pipeline to turn your machine learning Jupiter notebooks into something with a web UI that people can actually use.

We do agile because it helps, but we don’t get obsessed with it.
