## About us

 Fifth Continent are a web development agency. We help people turn their ideas into easy to use, thoughtful products, and we find the simplest way to do it. Our expertise is in the nuts and bolts, the backend processes and infrastructure that power digital products. 

We would be good people to talk to you if you have an idea for a new platform and you’re not sure how to start getting it online. We’d also be great people to talk to if your project is getting stuck in details and you can’t find your way through to launching. We can build the whole thing from a sketch on a piece of paper to production. We’re also happy to slot into an existing team, and help out where you need it, or just help you understand what you need to change to get things done.

We are small, but work with some of the largest companies. We are well practised at working remotely, so we can work with you wherever you are.
